The lender doesn't disclose what the loans can't be used for, but it does have specific uses for each loan. For example, the immigration loans can only be used for approved immigration-related expenses and weatherization loans can only finance specific home improvement projects.

The Impact Loans are more flexible and function more like a traditional personal loan. Borrowers can take them out for a variety of emergency expenses or purposes.

Because the restrictions aren't fully disclosed, call the customer service department before applying to make sure your intended purchase or expense is eligible for funding.
